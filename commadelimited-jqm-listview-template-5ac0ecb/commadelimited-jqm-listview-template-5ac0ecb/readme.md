# jQuery Mobile Icon Pack

Extending jQuery Mobile's default icon set.

This repository extends jQuery Mobile's icon set with an additional 33 icons. Icon categories include currency symbols, media control, social media, common application icons, and more. It also cleans up the original icons and makes them a little sharper. It also includes crisp hi-res icons for retina displays.

The icon pack overrides the default icon set completely.

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git@github.com:commadelimited/jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/commadelimited/jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack/zipball/master)

## Usage
Drop `jqm-icon-pack.css` and the associated images folder into your project. Image files are relative to the CSS file just like the original icons are. Use them just as you would the standard icons.
