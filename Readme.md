Information
===========

This repository is for my templates for use in jQuery Mobile, and for my notes.

I do not intend to use copyright materials without permission should any be located in my research.
 This is simply a learning repository.

 Anything I personally make and upload in a public repo is likely free to use unless stated otherwise.
